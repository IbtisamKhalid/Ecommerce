          Buying a high-value item or service online from an entity you don’t
          know comes with a lot of risk. You can’t ascertain how trustworthy the
          entity is, and you run the risk of being defrauded.

          TrustBridge offers you the peace of mind you need to make any

          sure the Seller provides tracking information, when applicable, for
          the transaction.

          Selling goods or services can be risky, especially if they’re highly

          Using TrustBridge, we verify the Buyer’s identity and verify the
          funding during the transaction. After the funds are secured, we will
          notify you when you can ship the item to the Buyer. During this
          process, you are required to provide us with tracking information. We
          use this information to make sure the Buyer receives their item and
          can’t claim otherwise. After the Buyer receives and accepts the item,
          TrustBridge releases the funds to you.
